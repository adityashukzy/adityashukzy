I'm a junior majoring in CompSci at the SRM Institute of Science & Tech. at Chennai, Tamil Nadu in India. I love building things out of nothing, solving problems and working with artificial intelligence. On my off time, I like to dabble in ideas surrounding the arts, history, philosophy and generally humanity at large. I'm an incorrigible lover of cinema and the tradition of storytelling, and also write stories and screenplays.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on GANs and expanding my scope of computer vision knowledge.

- ðŸŒ± As of now, I am learning more and more about GANs and Deep Learning. I hope to also work on NLP in the future.

- ðŸ‘¯ I would love to collaborate on projects & hackathons!

- ðŸ“« Feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/aditya-shukla-975940188/) or shoot me an [email](mailto:adityashukzy@gmail.com)!

P.S. : My three favorite movies of all time are Call Me By Your Name, Fight Club and Good Will Hunting!
