I'm a Computer Science sophomore at the SRM Institute of Science & Tech. at Chennai in Tamil Nadu, India. I love building things big and small, solving problems and working with artificial intelligence. In my leisure time, I'm also a fond player of chess, a perennial lover of knowledge, and a person who loves to dabble in big ideas!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ML, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. I have also recently dabbled a little in generative modelling (GANs)!

- ðŸŒ± As of now, I am learning Flutter to expand my app development skills, refining my Deep Learning concepts, and opening up to the incredible world of NLP (because it just seems so interesting!)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects, hackathons and novel research ideas!
